PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT STORY:
  In order to plan out how I would create this jokes web app I came up with an ERD.
  After I had that done I focused on the API(server) side of things (which was a long process and not that easy to set up).
  Once I was done with that I deployed the server.
  After the server was up and running I then focused on the client(web app) side of things.
